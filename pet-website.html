  <h2>What's special about Shiba? 🐾</h2>
  <p>
        An ancient Japanese breed, the <strong>Shiba Inu</strong>
        is a little but well-muscled dog once employed as a hunter. Today, the
        spirited, good-natured Shiba is the most popular companion dog in Japan.
        The adaptable Shiba is at home in town or country. Brought to America
        from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity
        in the West and are already the most popular breed in their homeland.
        Their white markings combined with their coloring (red, red sesame, or
        black and tan) and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them
        almost foxlike. They're sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident
        personality to match.</p>
